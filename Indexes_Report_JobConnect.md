# Indexes Report for JobConnect Admin Panel

## Overview

This document describes the indexes implemented on the `jobs` collection in the MongoDB database for the JobConnect Admin Panel project. Each index is listed alongside the queries and reports it supports, as well as the justification for its inclusion.

---

## ðŸ“„ Indexes Created

### 1. Index on `Date`
```js
db.jobs.createIndex({ "Date": 1 })
```

#### Queries Benefiting:
- Reports filtered by a date range (`fromDate` to `toDate`)

#### Usage Location:
- `GET /api/jobs/report` endpoint in `getReport()` controller
- Used to retrieve jobs between a given date range for analytics

#### Justification:
- Improves range queries for time-based reports
- Reduces scan time when filtering job entries by month or year

---

### 2. Index on `Company`
```js
db.jobs.createIndex({ "Company": 1 })
```

#### Queries Benefiting:
- Reports filtered by company name

#### Usage Location:
- Report page filters (dropdown)
- `getReport()` controller using `{ Company: req.query.company }`

#### Justification:
- Speeds up filtered reports for a specific company
- Enhances user experience by reducing response latency

---

### 3. Index on `Location`
```js
db.jobs.createIndex({ "Location": 1 })
```

#### Queries Benefiting:
- Location-based filtering on the report interface

#### Usage Location:
- `GET /api/jobs/report` with `location` filter

#### Justification:
- Reduces full collection scan when users filter jobs by city/state

---

### 4. Index on `Work Model`
```js
db.jobs.createIndex({ "Work Model": 1 })
```

#### Queries Benefiting:
- Filtering reports based on job work model (Remote, Hybrid, Onsite)
- Dynamic dropdown list of work models

#### Usage Location:
- `GET /api/jobs/work-models`
- `GET /api/jobs/report` when filtering by work model

#### Justification:
- Required to efficiently support dynamic dropdown
- Useful for aggregation of work model distribution

## âœ… Summary

These indexes ensure that user-facing reports and dropdown filters operate efficiently even with large job datasets. Indexing improves performance and prepares the application for future scalability.---

## ðŸ“Œ Note on Index Requirements

There is no minimum number of indexes required. However, indexes must support important and frequent queries, such as:
- Report generation queries
- Dynamic dropdown menu population
- Any user login or session-based access (if implemented)

These queries are accessed regularly by users and should be optimized using indexes to ensure responsiveness and scalability. This project includes indexes that align with those expectations.
